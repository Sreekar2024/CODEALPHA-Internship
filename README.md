# **Credit Scoring Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Internship Project - CODEALPHA**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing a **Credit Scoring Model** to assess the creditworthiness of individuals using **historical financial data**. By leveraging **classification algorithms**, the model predicts whether a person is likely to default on a loan or not. The project also evaluates different machine learning models to determine the most accurate and reliable approach.  

## **ðŸ“Œ Objectives**  
- Build a machine learning model for **credit risk assessment**.  
- Utilize **classification algorithms** such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.   
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve**.  

## **ðŸ“Œ Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python** (Google Colab)  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables  

## **ðŸ“Œ Dataset**  
The dataset consists of financial attributes such as **income, loan amount, credit history, debt-to-income ratio**, and other relevant features. The target variable indicates whether an individual is a **creditworthy borrower or a defaulter**.

## **ðŸ“Œ Expected Outcome**  
- A trained classification model capable of predicting **creditworthiness**.  
- Performance comparison between different classification algorithms.  
- A visual analysis of the dataset, including **correlation heatmaps, feature importance plots, and ROC curves**.
